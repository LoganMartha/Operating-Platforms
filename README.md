**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

  The Gaming Room client is a company that is looking to introduce a new web-based application for their game Draw It or Lose It.  They wanted a application that allowed for the game to have multiple teams with multiple players on each.  The names of the team and players    need to be unique and provide a check for the names.  Lastly, only one instance of the game can exist at a time.
  
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

  I felt that when it came to reading and converting the UML diagram to English was a strength within this document.  
  
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

  I felt being able to see the UML diagram and how each element worked together in a broader aspect helped when deciphering through the given code and making adjustments.
  
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

  If I were to go back and revise, I think I would add more detail within the requirements.  The more detail I can provide the easier it is to really understand and implement code.
  
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

  At the end of the day, the user knows best for how they want their application.  Being able to listen and implement user ideas will just benefit the application's success, since it is tailored to them.
  
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
  
  I waterfall like approach to designing this software.  In the future I will look to utilize and more agile ideology in order to be able to schedule more accurately.  I feel this flexible approach will benefit myself and the code.
